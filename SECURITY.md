# Vulnerability Disclosure Policy
Keeping traveller’s information safe and secure is a top priority and a core company value for us at Skyscanner. We highly appreciate the efforts of external security researchers who contribute to the safety of Skyscanner's users.

To submit a vulnerability you’ve found, you will first need to [sign up for free as a Bugcrowd researcher](https://bugcrowd.com/user/sign_up) and then submit your findings directly to our [programme](https://bugcrowd.com/skyscanner). We won’t consider any vulnerabilities submitted outside of Bugcrowd.
